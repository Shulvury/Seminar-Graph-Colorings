# Seminar-Graph-Colorings
Codes used during experimental part of seminar research for graph coloring. 
Python code was used to generate graphs and create following plots. Name of output files, number of inctances generated, and type of graph generated are all set manually in code, number of instances for plot creating and graph generating is different.
C++ code is modified code of R. Lewis with implementation of IDO and minor changes, number of instances to analyze for each probability, as well as number of different probabilities used is to be set manually in main via second_number and first_number variables
